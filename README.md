# stackoverflow-data-analysis
Data Analysis and deep dives on the stackoverflow survey dataset(s).

## Environment
The analysis uses python. The environment is managed using `pipenv`. [This link](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) will help you get started with `pipenv`. 

## Dataset
The datasets are all [stackoverflow surveys](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) from 2011 to 2020. To download the datasets and format them for use in this project automatically run the `get_the_data` notebook.

If there is a need to do this manually, download each zip from the website, extract the csv in the /data/ folder, and rename each csv to the respective year, e.g. `2011.csv` for the first survey conducted in 2011.
